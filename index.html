      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a teacher and baker and I am extremely excited for this course!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am origionally from North Idaho but I have lived all over the world the last 10 years.</h1>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love so many things it is hard to know where to begging. I think my favorite hobbie is baking, I used to be a proffesional cookie baker and it is still a passion. I also love music and hiking. Me and my partner have 2 insain dogs so we get out as much as possible!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Truethfully, I am doing this course becuase I am not sure. My dream job would be working in curriculum development for CK-12 Flexbooks but I am going to need A LOT more experience before that is anywhere near a reality. Realistically I would like to work anywhere that I will be able to use both my skills and tools from this class but also my understaning of education and curriculum. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>For now I live in Parker Colorado but we are hoping to move to Boulder this year. </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I would really like to get involved in online educational resources and I see this as a great avenue for that.</p>
